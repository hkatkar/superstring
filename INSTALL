superstring is a C++ program, so you need a C++ compiler to build it
(it's been developed with gcc 4.4 on Linux). It's built using autoconf
and automake, and because the repository doesn't contain the files
that they generate, you need both installed before starting the
build. The program also depends on libstree
(http://www.icir.org/christian/libstree), a generic suffix tree
library. The first part of the build is generating the makefiles:

autoheader
aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoconf

Once created, the generated files should stay OK even when you edit
superstring source code (autotools set the makefiles to remake
themselves when their source Makefile.am changes). Afterwards, the
build is the same as for any GNU distribution:

./configure
make
